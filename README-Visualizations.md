# Within this file are four samples of my work documenting my knowledge of three visialization tools:
* Tableau
* SnowFlake
* Power BI
* Looker Studio

Provided are limited code segments that generated my query to create my visualizations. As some services are paid subscriptions and
access likely to expire due to the cost to maintain the account (Power Bi and Snowflake), alternately I have provided screenshots of my work.
